## ML Internship Assignment 1 - House Price Prediction

**Introduction**
This project aims to predict house prices on the Ames housing dataset from Kaggle using regression techniques. The emphasis is on following best practices like:

- Git version control and GitHub flow
- Dependency management with poetry
- Documentation and visualizations
- Comparison of multiple regression algorithms
- The development will be done issue-by-issue. For each issue, a new branch will be created, changes made, and a pull request initiated before merging to main.

## Details

This project aims to accurately predict house prices based on a variety of features, using a dataset from a Kaggle competition. The goal is to experiment with different machine learning techniques, practice end to end machine learning workflows and build intuition around model performance.
